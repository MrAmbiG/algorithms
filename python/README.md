## Time complexity
1. Ω. Big Omega is used to represent the best-case scenario of an algorithm. When an algorithm is given the simplest data-structure possible as input.
2. O. BigO is used to represent the worst-case scenario of an algorithm. When an algorithm is given a very large and complex data-set as input.
3. Θ. Big Theta is used only when the time complexity of an algorithm is the same in both worst-case and best-case scenarios.
